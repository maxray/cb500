With the rear of the CB500 frame gone suddenly things started coming together. I had mocked up a cardboard seat to get a feel and with some searching found a grp mould available online. It was actually for a Honda CR but after an email to check I felt happy it could work. An added bonus was the site selling it also did seat pads too so I ordered one and waited for the parcel to arrive.

### Don't mess this up Sush!

It took me a while (and much checking) before I was ready to drill holes in the lovely cowel... it looked so perfect and it would be totally me to drill the holes in the opposite places. Thankfully it all went without a hitch and I could offer up the seat including pad onto the bike.

### Getting the angles right

Ideally with a cafe racer there are two constraints you want to work with to get a balanced bike. As a rule the center points of the wheels going up vertically- nothing should go past these points and horizontally nothing should be higher than the tank top. It is not critical and for this first phase it is only the rear that I am focusing on. 

It is also good to have the seat level and annoyingly the CB500 (this model at least) angles down so my next jobs will all involve some metal fabrication. Time to learn some new skills!

Now I have reached the part of the project where I need to learn I will start in a medium I know.. cardboard! 

### Next post... Prototype battery box
