Considering I do a desk bound job I have quite a healthy tool collection in my shed, probably a combination of wanting to try and do house based DIY myself and a childhood messing around in my Dads garage. He was a cabinet maker so give me a drill or sander and I am happy. 

### Well this is intimidating!

I hadn't encountered a proper need for an angle grinder before - cutting the back off the CB500 was going to be my first taste of them. 

I have always had a healthy respect for circular saws, and am going to add the angle grinder to that list... what a noisy and generally destructive thing it is!

### Measure twice cut once

One rule of woodwork that definitely applies is to double check your measurements. You can't glue pieces of bike frame back one easily and I have yet to learn to weld. :D

With things marked out and checked it was time to do the deed and, rather like a hot knife through butter the first cuts were made - there is no going back now.

With the frame chopped I can start looking at what needs to be fabricated, a rear hoop, electrics tray and a frame to mount the seat so it is horizontal. 

Whilst I think about this I can be getting on with a seat cowel and pad.

### Next post... Things start to take shape.
