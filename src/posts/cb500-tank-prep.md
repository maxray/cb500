My tank has at least two dings in it - one I "may" have done on my last track day at Cadwell and one that I didn't spot till I got the bike home when I bought it.

### Unleash the flap disk (again) 

I didn't have paint stripper strong enough to touch the cellulose job that had been done by the previous owner so I got busy with the angle grinder and got down to metal fairly quickly.  What became apparent was that the tank was more like a walnut than I expected with little dents all over.

### Fill for England 

I decided to get stuck in with filler and try and get things sorted. Unlikely to get it perfect but hoping the main issues can be ironed out.

### Get rid of those tabs

As I have my bike in a cafe style there is no need for the tabs that hold on some of the plastics from the original so it seemed a good time to Dremmel them off. It is some of these little things that will make the bike look more complete at the end.

### A lick of paint - and then more filling.

Once I had got things tidied I thought it good to get a little primer on and shine a nice bright light on it to see how much was still a problem. There were still issues so more filler went on and more sanding was done.

### Not too shabby and ready for paint!

Finally the tank is ready for its base coat of paint. Pretty happy with the result and hopefully once it has a proper paint job and is back on the bike it should look crackin..

**Next time... will I manage to replace my shims?**
