After missing out on Mallory Park in October due to crap weather we went into winter, and another lockdown. The dissapointment of not getting to try out the bike on track was tempered by social distancing and mild panic at the state of the 3rd wave of the pandemic.

### Start looking ahead

With no need to worry about riding the bike for a while I decided to move onto the next stage of the project, removing the standard pillion pegs and replacing them with rearsets. 

As it happens there is a race series dedicated to the CB500 called Thundersport, so finding something suitable was much easier than I might have thought. Joining a couple of Facebook groups soon got me in touch with some people who either made parts or sold them as part of their racing.

### "They just bolt on mate"

A piece of engineering beauty, I was told you could pretty much just bolt these on to replace the stock footpegs - so I happily trundled off to the shed to see. 

Yeah - turns out (as with lots of things in life) that there is more to it than just bolting them on. Fitting them was easy enough, but I noted that it was impossible to get the rod for the drum brake to line up without fouling the swing arm. 

Some more googling and searching and I noted that the race bike turn the lever on the drum brake upside down, so it was time to remove the rear wheel and see how to do it.

The drum lever was easy to swap around, but in order to link everything back up I was time to get some threaded bar, nuts and some sheet metal and fashion something myself. It took a while but eventually I got things working correctly.

#### With the rearsets on, it is time to think about some clip ons... but first an actual track day was booked... what could possibly go wrong.
