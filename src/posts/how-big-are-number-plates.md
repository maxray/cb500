Let's be honest... number plates ruin the look of bikes. Sadly in order to ride mine on the road I would need to think of somewhere to mount it where the MOT tester would be ok with it.

### Back to cardboard - again

I had two options really, a hugger style mount or some sort of tail tidy that would clear the rear wheel. Out came the cardboard again to try some options.

Neither options were filling me with glee and so I decided to go with the simplest. I could cut the whole piece out of 2mm sheet and then just bend where needed.

### Original means less work

My aim was getting a bit clearer now, this rear unit would be something I could bolt on/off easily to allow me to enjoy the bike without the awful lights and plate for track days and the have as an 'MOT passer' - phase 2 will be a prettier but potentially less legal rear. :)

Now I know this doesn't look amazing BUT, the switch gear and lights all plugged back in easily and everything still worked. There is a chink of light at the end of the tunnel.
