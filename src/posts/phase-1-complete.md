Things have been a little odd recently, ok that is a gross under statment! Life has been insane dealing with the pandemic, schooling children and trying to pay the bills.

### The MOT day cometh

By August things had started to ease and I needed to take the little CB to get an MOT. This filled me with dread, would the tester throw me and the bike out the door with a big Fail?

To me the bike was looking good and as far as I knew the light placements and spacings were legal.

### We have a problem

Test day was a scorcher... like a 34+ degree day. So I melted as I took the short trip to the garage and dropped off the bike. The process is pretty quick, maybe 30minutes or so and soon enough the tester was tapping on his computer.

It was a fail! BUT not for my welding... I had neglected to add a rear reflector which is a lega requirement. I raced home and surveyed the shed and spied my kids bicycle.

15mins later I was back at the MOT station with a hastely glued on schilds bike reflector and the result was a pass!

I feel super happy to have reached this point, and celebrated by booking a track day for October :D

There is lots more to do to the bike but the first stage is complete. After the track day in October it will be time to start Phase 2 and think abouts a colour scheme to repaint it.

#### For now though I am going to enjoy where I have got to and start researching some decent tyres for Mallory Park :)
