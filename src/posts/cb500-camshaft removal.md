A couple of weeks ago I finally plucked up the courage to open my engine and measure the valve clearances. With new shims in my grubby hands it was time to set about swapping them.

### Do not cock this up! 

In order to change the valve shims you first need to remove the cam shafts. I read the instructions in the Haynes Manual several times whilst having a builders tea (or 3) and found myself feeling a little anxious.

### Let's do this properly 

First thing you need to do is to remove the cam chain tensioner. Once again I had to make another order (I should read ahead a little more) for a gasket to replace the old one when it was reattached. To remove the tensioner you need to wind in the tensioner using a Honda tensioner key. I didn't have one but there is a pattern in the manual so I decided to make one rather than the alternative of using a screwdriver.

With the tensioner wound up it was just a couple of bolts to remove and extract.

### This may wreck your engine 

The next part is easy yet hard. The 2 camshafts each have two cam holders with 4 bolts each. These bolts need to be loosened evenly, if you don't use a criss cross pattern and take your time you can bend a valve or worse damage the cam holders. These cannot just be replaced so a mess up here would mean a whole new upper part of the engine.

With trepidation I worked a criss cross pattern on each cam shaft rather than on each cam holder, quarter turn by quarter turn and with no real need for a fanfare they were loose. You never want to drop anything into the engine especially down into the depths where the cam chain runs and so I had near white knuckles as I moved each bolt very carefully. I only had one thing left to do to expose the valves.

### Disengage the cam sprockets from the cam chain 

This took me a while to figure out and I am not too excited about doing the reverse later... however, eventually by moving one cam shaft up and forwards I got enough slack in the chain to remove it. I decided at this point to add an extra zip tie as a fail safe to stop the chain falling into the depths of the engine.

And so here we are... the valve followers are exposed and under each one is a little shim I need to replace. When my molybdenum disulfide grease turns up tomorrow I will be good to try swapping the shims and getting this sucker back together! 

**Next time... shims, grease and hopefully not TOO much swearing...**
