Rather like passing the shortest day of the year, it feels like I have hit a milestone now that the bike is in pieces. 

### The pendulum begins to swing back

Everything I do now is progress towards a working bike rather than taking something apart. The mucky work is very much not over though as there are parts to clean, a tank to strip, an engine to sort and a frame that needs some TLC!

### Sand and sand and sand and...

As much as I would like to go the whole hog and get everything shot blasted and powder coated I need to be realistic. This was always going to be a learning project, and as such the initial bike was at a price I could afford to write off if things went wrong. With that in mind the clean up and re build is going to be more rattle can and less powder coating.

### This may take a while 

Sanding and scrapng the frame is a much longer and time consuming job, but I am willing to put time in if it keeps the bill low.  Little by little the frame revealed itself and to be honest isn't in too bad condition at all. 




**Next time... time to start cleaning, prepping and then rebuilding...**
