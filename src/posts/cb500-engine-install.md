With the engine finally done I was excited to try and get it back into the frame and start the rebuild proper.

### Many hands would make light work 

So obviously this would be a quick job with a few pairs of hands but sadly there was just me so - as per other times during this project I made a brew and had a think.

Getting the engine out of the frame was hard but putting it back posed some challenges and I needed to keep in mind once it was in I needed to get the frame and engine up onto paddock stands.

### and heavvvvve!

I decided to put the engine on a pallet

### Tippex and some blind luck 

Putting the camshafts back involves getting the chain fitted at the bottom of the engine and then keeping tension on the chain as the camshaft goes back in the same position it was taken out. I used a little tippex to note where the chain and sprockets were just to give me a fighting chance of getting it back exactly as it was. 

I wouldn't know until I tried to fire the engine - but if the timing was off it could cause real problems in the engine.

### The simple pleasure of a torque wrench 

It shouldn't be a new thing to me but I am ashamed to say until playing with the engine I have always tightened things with a pure guess at the torque they should be under. A christmas present treat to myself meant I now have a lightweight torque wrench for more delicate things with a 2-24NM range. 

The click when you reach the correct torque is one of the most satisfying things ever!


Making sure I was very even and tightening in a criss cross pattern the cam holders were back on and I took the chance to replace the gasket on the valve cover whilst I was at it. 

BIG moment, the engine is now done - just got to hope I can put the bike back together and get it to fire again!!

**Next time... how on earth do I get the engine back into the frame??**
