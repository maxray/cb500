As mentioned in the last update I am rapidly getting into new territory. Whilst researching gasless welders and soaking up 'How to weld' videos on Youtube I was keen to keep making progress. I like model making and have used cardboard in various ways over my life so have decided to mock up the electrics tray and battery box in order to create a pattern I can then use to start fabrication.

A quick trip to Hobbycraft turned up some nice card which would do the job perfectly. I am going to use the existing battery for phase 1 and keep it roughly where it was. Although I want to move the battery into the seat and swap for a Lithium Ion one I also want to ride the bike soon. :)

You can work so quickly with simple materials and make mistakes that don't cost anything.. I can get on board with this kind of working. :)

And so with the mock up made I fitted it to the - oh no I didn't plan any give whatsoever and my lovely box wont fit into the frame... curses! It is only card though and the next version will be much better.
